The corresponding comets R package is available on GitHub and CRAN.\n\n\n\n\nAug 2024\n\n\nNew publication 🎉 “Model-based causal feature selection for general response types” has been accepted for publication in the Journal of the American Statistical Association. Software implementing our method is available in the R package tramicp on GitHub and on CRAN.\n\n\n\n\nApr 2024\n\n\nNew publication 🎉 “Estimating Conditional Distributions with Neural Networks using R package deeptrafo” got accepted for publication in the Journal of Statistical Software. Software is available on CRAN.\n\n\n\n\nMar 2024\n\n\nI started my new role as Assistant Professor of Statistics at the Institute for Statistics and Mathematics of the Vienna University for Economics and Business.\n\n\n\n\nFeb 2023\n\n\nI successfully defended my PhD thesis titled “Deep Learning and Causal Inference with Transformation Models” at the University of Zurich, Switzerland.\n\n\n\n\nJan 2023\n\n\nI acquired a postdoctoral mobility grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation for my proposal on Distributional Instrumental Variables Estimation (DIVE). During the fellowship, I will be working with Niklas Pfister and Jonas Peters at the University of Copenhagen, starting March 2023."

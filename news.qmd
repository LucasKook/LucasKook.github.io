* New preprint: ["Model-based causal feature selection for general response
types"](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2309.12833) in collaboration with
Sorawit Saengkyongam, Anton Rask Lundborg, Torsten Hothorn and Jonas Peters.
Software implementing our method is available as an R package (`tramicp` [on
GitHub](https://github.com/LucasKook/tramicp) and 
[on CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tramicp)).

* I acquired a postdoctoral mobility grant from the Swiss National Science
Foundation for my proposal on [Distributional Instrumental Variables Estimation 
(DIVE)](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/214457).
During the first year of the fellowship, I will be working with
[Niklas Pfister](https://niklaspfister.github.io/) and [Jonas
Peters](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~jopeters/) at the University of Copenhagen,
starting March 2023.

* I successfully defended my PhD thesis titled "Deep Learning and Causal
Inference with Transformation Models" on February 8, 2023.

* New preprint: ["Estimating Conditional Distributions with Neural Networks using 
R package deeptrafo"](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2211.13665) with 
[software](https://cran.r-project.org/package=deeptrafo) available on CRAN

    I acquired a postdoctoral mobility grant from the Swiss National Science
Foundation for my proposal on [Distributional Instrumental Variables Estimation
(DIVE)](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/214457). During the fellowship, I will
be working with [Niklas Pfister](https://niklaspfister.github.io/) and [Jonas
Peters](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~jopeters/) at the University of Copenhagen,
starting March 2023. </td>

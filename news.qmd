* In March 2024, I started my new role as assistant professor of statistics
at the Institute for Statistics and Mathematics of the Vienna University for
Economics and Business.

* New preprint :tada: ["Algorithm-agnostic significance testing in supervised 
learning with multimodal data"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14416) in 
collaboration with [Anton Rask Lundborg](https://www.arlundborg.com). The 
corresponding `comets` R package is available on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/LucasKook/comets.git) and [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=comets).

* New preprint :tada: ["Model-based causal feature selection for general 
response types"](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2309.12833) in collaboration 
with Sorawit Saengkyongam, Anton Rask Lundborg, Torsten Hothorn and Jonas 
Peters. Software implementing our method is available as an R package (`tramicp` 
[on GitHub](https://github.com/LucasKook/tramicp) and 
[on CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tramicp)).

* I acquired a postdoctoral mobility grant from the Swiss National Science
Foundation for my proposal on [Distributional Instrumental Variables Estimation 
(DIVE)](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/214457). During the fellowship, I will
be working with [Niklas Pfister](https://niklaspfister.github.io/) and [Jonas
Peters](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~jopeters/) at the University of Copenhagen,
starting March 2023.

* I successfully defended my PhD thesis titled "Deep Learning and Causal
Inference with Transformation Models" in February 2023.

* New preprint :tada: ["Estimating Conditional Distributions with Neural 
Networks using R package deeptrafo"](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2211.13665)
with [software](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=deeptrafo) available on CRAN.

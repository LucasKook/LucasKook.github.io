* I acquired a postdoctoral mobility grant from the Swiss National Science
Foundation. During the first year of the fellowship, I will be working with
[Niklas Pfister](https://niklaspfister.github.io/) and [Jonas
Peters](http://web.math.ku.dk/~peters/) at the University of Copenhagen,
starting March 2023.

* I succesfully defended my PhD thesis titled "Deep Learning and Causal
Inference with Transformation Models" on February 8, 2023.

* New preprint: ["Estimating Conditional Distributions with Neural Networks using 
R package deeptrafo"](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2211.13665) with 
[software](https://cran.r-project.org/package=deeptrafo) available on CRAN

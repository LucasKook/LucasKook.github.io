title: "About me"

I am a PhD student in biostatistics at the University of Zurich supervised
jointly by Prof. Beate Sick and Prof. Torsten Hothorn. My research interests are
combining distributional regression models with deep learning approaches and
causal inference to improve treatment decisions for acute ischemic stroke
patients.

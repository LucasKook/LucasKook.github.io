title: "About me"
---

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in statistics and causal inference at
the [Copenhagen Causality Lab](https://cocala.github.io/). Together with [Niklas
Pfister](https://niklaspfister.github.io) and [Jonas 
Peters](http://web.math.ku.dk/~peters/), I work at the intersection of 
distributional regression and causal inference with a focus on biomedical
applications. 

In February 2023, I finished my PhD at the University of Zurich under the 
supervision of [Beate 
Sick](https://www.ebpi.uzh.ch/en/aboutus/departments/biostatistics/teambiostats/sick.html)
and [Torsten Hothorn](http://user.math.uzh.ch/hothorn/). My PhD research focused 
on combining distributional regression models with deep learning approaches and 
causal inference to improve treatment decisions for acute ischemic stroke 
patients.
